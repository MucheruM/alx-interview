<h1>0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><h2>I</h2>n this project I am required to create an in place algorithm
to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.</p>

<h2> Key Concepts required to grasp the Project include </h2>
<li>
	<ul>Matrix Representation in Python:

Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.</ul>
	  <ul>In-place Operations:

Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.</ul>
	  <ul>Matrix Transposition:

Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.</ul>
	  <ul>Reversing Rows in a Matrix:

Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.</ul>
	  <ul>Nested Loops:
Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
	  </ul>
	  
</li>
